Hi, I'm Steve Barnett.

I'm a **human-centered front-end developer and user experience designer**. I help software teams **have happier customers and make better software** by becoming **more human-centered**.

I  live somewhere between the worlds of back-end development and interface design. I help **bridge the gap between development and design** by switching between my FED and UX roles as needed; often I do one, then the other. I make personas and wireframes with the designers (what should we build?) and write code and tests with the developers (how should we build it?). 

I design and develop sites and apps in a future friendly way: with an eye towards **inclusive design**, **accessibility**, and **performance**. That means a site that everyone can use, regardless of their device, the network theyâ€™re on, or any disabilities they might have.
